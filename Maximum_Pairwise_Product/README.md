# Exceuting the stress_test_gen.py
To run the main file run the following command within your terminal `python stress_test_gen.py`. The program will take three user inputs in the following format: `n max_numb seed`. Where
- `n`: is the length of the list to generate 
- `max_numb`: sets the maximum range of numbers to generate from 
- `seed`: sets the random seed for reproducibility
This will save the newly generated list into `input.txt` file within the same directory. 

# Executing max_pairwise_product.py
To run max_pairwise_product file run the following command within your terminal `python max_pairwise_product.py`. The program will then take a list as a user input and output the maximum pairwise product from that list. 

To run max_pairwise_product using input from the input.txt file we run the following code in the terminal: `python max_pairwise_product.py < input.txt`.
