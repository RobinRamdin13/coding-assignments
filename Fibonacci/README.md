### Note:
Since we are using the pisano periods in most cases, the sum of the pisano for modulo 10 is equal to zero (i.e `sum(pisano_for_mod_10)%10 == 0`). In the case of modulo 10 we are no longer required to compute the number of indexs as anything into 0 is zero. However it was left in all scripts so it can be adapted to different modulo.
